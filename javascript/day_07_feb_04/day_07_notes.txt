functions
=========
1. pre-defined/built-in functions : console.log(), alert(), prompt()
2. User Defined Functions


Functions can be written:
    1. Function Declaration / Named Functions
    2. Function Expression / anonymous function
    3. Arrow Functions (ES_6)



Function Declaration  VS  Function Expression
=============================================
1. Function Declarations are named , Function Expressions are anonymous
2. Function Declarations are hoisted, Function Expressions are not hoisted



HigherOrder Function : a function that takes another function as argument
CallBack Function : a function that is passed as argument to another function



Arrow Function 
==============
-shorter in syntax
-don't use function keyword
-'return' can be skipped
-function body is optional
-anonymous
-are not hoisted


this
====
-its a keyword
-'this' refers to a specific object and acts as a reference to the current execution context



Arrow Function Limitation
==========================
1. arrow functions cannot be used as object methods
   we shouldn't use arrow functions in object literals


Arrow Function Benefits
=======================
-Arrow functions dont have their own 'this' , they use 'this' from their lexical/outer
-'this' inside arrow function is static
