How Javascript Works
====================
-When a JavaScript program runs, 1 Global Execution Context (GEC) is created.
-For every function call, a new Function Execution Context (FEC) is created.
-Execution Context = the environment in which code executes.
-Each execution context has two phases: 
	1. creation phase. (Memory is allocated for variables and functions; 'var' variables are initialized with undefined)
	2. execution phase. (Code is executed line by line; variables receive their assigned values and functions are invoked)
