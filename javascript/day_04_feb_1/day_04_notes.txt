Datatypes
=========
-Type of Data we are dealing with

2 types : primitive , non-primitive

primitives : 
    number : 4 , 4.5 , -2.3 
    string : 'sachin' , '15' , 'true' 
    boolean : true / false
    undefined : undefined
    bigint
    symbol
non-primitive : Object



primitives vs non-primitives
============================
-primitives are immutable, non-primitives are mutable.
-primititves are compared by value , non-primitives are compared by referrence/address




undefined vs null
=================
-when a variable is declared without any value , javascript assigns 'undefined' value to that variable.
-null is an intentional value assigned by developers.
-typeof 'undefined' undefined , typeof null is object.
